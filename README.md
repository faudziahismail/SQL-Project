# Overview 
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis(EDA) using SQL. Best practice approach were used to prepare and analyze dataset.

# Key Task 
- **Data Cleaning** : Removed Duplicates, Standardize the Data, Missing values and Remove Any Columns
- **EDA** : Analyzing the layoffs trends in various companies across different industry sectors

# Tools 
- I used the MySQL program to write in the SQL Language to query from the dataset.

# Datasets 
- The dataset used in this project was provided by Alex The Analyst as part of his SQL course. You can find the original dataset and learning materials here:
  [Alex the Analyst-SQL Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT1RErkfLNQ)
  
# Next Steps 
I plan to document my queries and findings in detail soon. Stay tuned for updates!

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning 

1. Create a layoff staging table which maintains the intergrity of the original raw data
  - layoffs_staging is a duplicate of the origanal table 
```sql
CREATE TABLE LAYOFFS_STAGING   
LIKE LAYOFFS;

Insert LAYOFFS_STAGING
SELECT*
FROM LAYOFFS
;
```
**Result**: 

<kbd><img width="602" alt="Layoff_staging_Table1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af406c6a-620c-409d-927f-869cf7fe74fe" />

2. Remove Duplicates

To do this, we will need to create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to store and partition it for every column. This feedbacks it back into the row_num column.  

```sql
(SELECT *, 
 ROW_NUMBER () OVER(
 PARTITION BY COMPANY,LOCATION, INDUSTRY, TOTAL_LAID_OFF, PERCENTAGE_LAID_OFF, `DATE`,STAGE
 ,COUNTRY,FUNDS_RAISED_MILLIONS) AS ROW_NUM
FROM layoffs_staging
)
```

This returns back the rows that has any repetition by filter using row num > 1 .
```sql
SELECT *
FROM DUPLICATE_CTE
WHERE ROW_NUM >1
;
```

**Results**: <br>
This displays the lists of companies that has duplicates.

Now we create second table with the same columns and an additional row_num column into another database layoffs_staging2, to filter out to duplicates as shown above. As CTE cannot be directly deleted.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `layoffs_staging2` (
  `company` text,
  `location` text,
  `industry` text,
  `total_laid_off` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `percentage_laid_off` text,
  `date` text,
  `stage` text,
  `country` text,
  `funds_raised_millions` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `ROW_NUM` INT   # ADDING A NEW COLUMN = ROW_NUM 
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

Insert the data from layofss_staging into layoffs_staging2. Delete company that have the row_num > 1.

```sql
INSERT INTO LAYOFFS_STAGING2
SELECT *, 
 ROW_NUMBER () OVER(
 PARTITION BY COMPANY,LOCATION, INDUSTRY, TOTAL_LAID_OFF, PERCENTAGE_LAID_OFF, `DATE`,STAGE
 ,COUNTRY,FUNDS_RAISED_MILLIONS) AS ROW_NUM
FROM layoffs_staging
;

DELETE 
FROM LAYOFFS_STAGING2
WHERE ROW_NUM >1 ;
```
**Results** :<br>
Removed the duplicates sucessfully! Hereâ€™s a snippet showcasing a cleaned dataset for one company, confirming all duplicate rows have been eliminated.

3. Standardize Data 
  - Trim <br>
  Trim the white spaces on the front & back end of the company column. Then the updated company name to the trim(company) we have created.

````sql
SELECT Company, TRIM(Company)
FROM layoffs_staging2
;
````
**Results**: <br>
<kbd><img width="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c416c2b9-f346-4a44-9d2c-97bb4a475df6" />

- Group the names of the same industry into one, as Crypto is also Crypto Currency.

```sql
UPDATE LAYOFFS_STAGING2 
SET INDUSTRY = 'Crypto'
WHERE INDUSTRY LIKE 'CRYPTO%'
;
```

- Removing inconsistent data of country for the same name -United States into one.
  
Before:<br>
<kbd><img width="145" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d4a0056-68dc-4536-ac29-e1d87e7d4fa4" />

````SQL
SELECT DISTINCT COUNTRY, TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM COUNTRY)
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY 1;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 
SET COUNTRY = trim(trailing '.' FROM country)
WHERE COUNTRY LIKE 'UNITED STATES%'
;
````
- Removed the '.' in United States and updated the column to the trimmed column country we made.

- Changing the Date which is a text into a standard date format and date type.
  
```sql
SELECT `date`
STR_TO_DATE(`date`,'%m/%d/%Y',)
FROM LAYOFSS_STAGING2
;

UPDATE LAYOFSS_STAGING2
SET`date` = STR_TO_DATE('date`,%m,%d,%Y)
;

ALTER TABLE LAYOFFS_STAGING2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;
```

4. Remove Nulls and Blanks
- Change Blank Values into Nulls
- Populate the blanks with existing data using JOIN tables

  ```sql
  UPDATE layoffs_staging2
  SET industry = NULL
  WHERE indusry = ''
  ;
  SELECT *
  FROM layoffs_staging2 t1
  JOIN layofss_staging2 t2
      ON t1.company = t2.company
  WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '')
  AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL

  UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
  JOIN layofss_staging2 t2
    ON t1.company = t2.company
  SET t1.industry =t2.industry
  WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
  AND t2.industry is NOT NULL
  ;
  ```

**Results** : <br>
<kbd><img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c7d76ee-9cd3-4538-8397-bcd5dfb7425e" />

5. Remove Columns & Rows
- Delete Rows wherer total_laif_off is blank and percentage_laid_off is NULL
- Absent values on these 2 columns makes the data irrelevant

```sql
DELETE
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL
;
```
Previously, we created a row_num column to filter out duplicates in every column.<br>
Now, we are dropping the column as we do not need it anymore.

```sql
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN ROW_NUM;
```
