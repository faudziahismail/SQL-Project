# Overview 
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis(EDA) using SQL. Best practice approach were used to prepare and analyze dataset.

# Key Task 
- **Data Cleaning** : Removed Duplicates, Standardize the Data, Missing values and Remove Any Columns
- **EDA** : Analyzing the layoffs trends in various companies across different industry sectors

# Tools 
- I used the MySQL program to write in the SQL Language to query from the dataset.

# Datasets 
- The dataset used in this project was provided by Alex The Analyst as part of his SQL course. You can find the original dataset and learning materials here:

# Next Steps 
I plan to document my queries and findings in detail soon. Stay tuned for updates!

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning 

1. Create a layoff staging table which maintains the intergrity of the original raw data
  - layoffs_staging is a duplicate of the origanal table 
```
CREATE TABLE LAYOFFS_STAGING   
LIKE LAYOFFS;

Insert LAYOFFS_STAGING
SELECT*
FROM LAYOFFS
;
```
**Result**:

2. Remove Duplicates

To do this, we will need to create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to store and partition it for every column. This feedbacks it back into the row_num column.  

```
(SELECT *, 
 ROW_NUMBER () OVER(
 PARTITION BY COMPANY,LOCATION, INDUSTRY, TOTAL_LAID_OFF, PERCENTAGE_LAID_OFF, `DATE`,STAGE
 ,COUNTRY,FUNDS_RAISED_MILLIONS) AS ROW_NUM
FROM layoffs_staging
)
```

This returns back the rows that has any repetition by filter using row num > 1 .
```
SELECT *
FROM DUPLICATE_CTE
WHERE ROW_NUM >1
;
```

**Results**: <br>
This displays the lists of companies that has duplicates.

Now we create second table with the same columns and an additional row_num column into another database layoffs_staging2, to filter out to duplicates as shown above. As CTE cannot be directly deleted.

```
CREATE TABLE `layoffs_staging2` (
  `company` text,
  `location` text,
  `industry` text,
  `total_laid_off` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `percentage_laid_off` text,
  `date` text,
  `stage` text,
  `country` text,
  `funds_raised_millions` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `ROW_NUM` INT   # ADDING A NEW COLUMN = ROW_NUM 
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

Insert the data from layofss_staging into layoffs_staging2. Delete company that have the row_num > 1.

```
INSERT INTO LAYOFFS_STAGING2
SELECT *, 
 ROW_NUMBER () OVER(
 PARTITION BY COMPANY,LOCATION, INDUSTRY, TOTAL_LAID_OFF, PERCENTAGE_LAID_OFF, `DATE`,STAGE
 ,COUNTRY,FUNDS_RAISED_MILLIONS) AS ROW_NUM
FROM layoffs_staging
;

DELETE 
FROM LAYOFFS_STAGING2
WHERE ROW_NUM >1 ;
```
**Results** :<br>
Removed the duplicates sucessfully! Hereâ€™s a snippet showcasing a cleaned dataset for one company, confirming all duplicate rows have been eliminated.

3. Standardize Data 
  - Trim <br>
  Trim the white spaces on the front & back end of the company column.
